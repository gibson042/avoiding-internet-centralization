Often in examples I've seen the intermediation is\r\nnot a network but a mediator between the two ends. This can be\r\ncentralizing due to two sided market dynamics or decentralizing due to\r\nready access to many intermediates and a reduction in trust invested\r\nin an endpoint.\r\n>\r\n> From a network perspective all devices transporting packets are\r\nintermediaries between the hosts that ultimately generate them. While\r\nencryption does reduce the possible intervention of these boxes,\r\nthere's quite a few cases where they do do things, and even without\r\ncentralization manage to undercut permissionless innovation.\r\n\r\n... and I replied:\r\n\r\n> I may have been infected by a legal/policy perspective that assumes a much broader definition of 'intermediation' -- will try to clarify to get everyone on the same page.",
